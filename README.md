# Description

Repo running the scipy tests in Pyodide daily.

You can run all tests by module like this:
```bash
python run-tests-by-modules.py
```

# Up-to-date status

See [conftest.py](./conftest.py) for skipped and xfailed tests. Right now, with
skipped and xfailed tests, the tests for all submodules test pass, see
`expected_tests_results` in [run-tests-by-module.py](./run-tests-by-module.py).

# Manually curated list of issues

Not updated very often, I should do some kind of high-level summary one day ...
